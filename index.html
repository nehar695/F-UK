            <h2>Pump Fun Updates Terms to Block UK Users Days After FCA Warning</h2>
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/pump-fun-updates-terms-to-block-uk-users-days-after-fca-warning/" target="_blank">CryptoSlate</a></p>
            <p>Crypto exchange Pump Fun has updated its terms of service to block users from the United Kingdom. The move comes just days after the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning about the platform's activities.</p>

            <p>The FCA, in its statement, expressed concerns over Pump Fun's operations within the UK and its lack of registration with the financial regulator. The authority's warning highlighted the platform’s failure to adhere to local regulations, which include strict rules on anti-money laundering (AML) measures and consumer protection.</p>

            <p>As a response, Pump Fun swiftly updated its terms and conditions, explicitly blocking users based in the UK. The company stated that it would no longer serve UK-based customers due to “regulatory uncertainty” and ongoing discussions with the FCA.</p>

            <p>The FCA’s warning has added to the increasing scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial services operating in the UK. Regulators have been stepping up their efforts to ensure that platforms comply with UK laws aimed at protecting consumers and preventing financial crime.</p>

            <p>This latest development could have wider implications for other crypto platforms operating in the UK, as more exchanges might be forced to revise their terms or cease operations in the region due to increasing regulatory pressure.</p>
